# BowBash-Public
Minecraft BowBash Plugin like on Dustmc.

That´s basically it. We´re trying to recreate the old Dustmc feel of BowBash, by creating an almost exact copy of the original BowBash. This plugin is in it´s earliest stages and may have major bugs that may even make the Minigame unplayable.

This Repo is just for Issue-Tracking and posting the releases on GitHub
